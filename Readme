AR-Furniture
============

Compact README for the AR-Furniture project (client + server).

Overview
--------
AR-Furniture is a two-part web application: a React + Vite client and a Node/Express server. The client provides an AR-enabled furniture shopping UI and admin pages; the server exposes REST APIs, authentication, and audit/notification features.

Repository layout
-----------------
- client/ — front-end app (Vite + React + TypeScript)
  - src/ — application source
  - public/ — static assets
  - package.json — client scripts and deps
- server/ — back-end (Node/Express)
  - src/ — app, controllers, routes, middleware
  - migrations/, seed/ — DB setup and seed data
  - package.json — server scripts and deps


Quick prerequisites
-------------------
- Node.js LTS (16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL (if using local DB) or configured Supabase project

Environment
-----------
Create `.env` files in the `server/` (and `client/` if required) with values similar to:

- SERVER_PORT=3000
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
- JWT_SECRET=replace_with_secure_secret
- SUPABASE_URL=...
- SUPABASE_KEY=...

Client setup (development)
--------------------------
From the `client/` folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The client uses Vite; open the printed local URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

Server setup (development)
--------------------------
From the `server/` folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Typical server scripts (check `server/package.json`):
- `dev` — run server in development (nodemon)
- `start` — start production server
- `migrate` / `seed` — run migrations and seed scripts (if present)

Database & migrations
---------------------
The `server/migrations/` folder includes SQL migration files. Run your chosen migration tool or scripts in `server/` to create tables and seeds before starting the server.

Testing
-------
- Check `client/package.json` and `server/package.json` for available `test` scripts.

Deployment notes
----------------
- Client can be built with `npm run build` in `client/` and deployed to static hosts (Vercel, Netlify).
- Server can be deployed to any Node-friendly host (Heroku, Azure App Service, DigitalOcean App Platform) with the required environment variables.
- For realtime notifications and auth, confirm Supabase or equivalent services are configured.

Contributing
------------
- Fork the repo and open a PR for changes.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Add notes to this README if you add new scripts or services.
